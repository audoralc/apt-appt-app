outstanding issues

- modal event bubbling - possible fix handleModal conditional so 2nd click does not flip state back - direct true & false values result in modal not working 

- appts when passed down to Hour via props turns up empty 

- correct syntax for already booked hour rendering, array needs to be flattened one level or some kind of array[i] method, or maybe another map but idk
