apt - a simple MERN appointment app

### frontend

After 3 failed attempts to implement a Flux/Redux architecture, I decided to prioritize the team's time while still presenting a working app that demonstrates my ability.

Apologies for not fulfilling that story - I had issues making everything connect, but would be happy to talk about my process with the actions & reducers & store. ðŸ˜…

In lieu of flux/Redux, I did try to use some of the great new flux-y type features in in React 16.3 like context for existing appointments & a portal for the modal.

The context API acts very much like a store & provides to nested children. Portals also offer a way to circumvent the traditional one-way dataflow too. I hope these are acceptable substitutes.
